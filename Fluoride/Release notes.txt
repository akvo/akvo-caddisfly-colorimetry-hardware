Description:
The first iteration of the phone-attachment version of Caddisfly. The fluoride test is performed by filling a sample of water in the test chamber, fitting a reagent 
filled capsule into the lid, and shutting the cartridge to allow the liquids to mix. The cartridge is then placed in the rubber sleeve, and slipped into the phone case 
attachment.
